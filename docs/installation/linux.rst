Install Java
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Update your apt sources with this command:

::

  echo "deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stretch-backports.list

2. Run apt-get update:

::

  sudo apt-get update

neo4j will now automatically pull from that repo when it needs to install Java as part of its
install process

Install neo4j
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Add the neo4j repo to your apt sources:

::

  wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.com/neotechnology.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
  echo 'deb https://debian.neo4j.com stable 4.0' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list
  sudo apt-get update

2. Install apt-transport-https with apt

::

  apt-get install apt-transport-https

2. Install neo4j community edition using apt:

::

  sudo apt-get install neo4j

3. Stop neo4j

::

  systemctl stop neo4j

4. Start neo4j as a console application and verify it starts up without errors:

::

  cd /usr/bin
  ./neo4j console

.. note:: It is very common for people to host neo4j on a Linux system, but use the BloodHound
   GUI on a different system. neo4j by default only allows local connections. To allow remote
   connections, open the neo4j configuration file (vim /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf) and edit this line:

   #dbms.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0

   Remove the # character to uncomment the line. Save the file, then start neo4j up again

5. Start neo4j up again. You have two options:

Run neo4j as a console application:

::

  cd /usr/bin
  ./neo4j console

Or use systemctl to start neo4j:

::

  systemctl start neo4j

6. Open a web browser and navigate to https://localhost:7474/. You should see the neo4j web console.

7. Authenticate to neo4j in the web console with username neo4j, password neo4j. Youâ€™ll be prompted
   to change this password.
