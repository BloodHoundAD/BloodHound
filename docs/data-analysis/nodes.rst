Nodes
=====

Nodes represent principals and other objects in Active Directory.
BloodHound stores certain information about each node on the node
itself in the neo4j database, and the GUI automatically performs
several queries to gather insights about the node, such as how
privileged the node is, or which GPOs apply to the node, etc. Simply
click the node in the BloodHound GUI, and the "Node Info" tab will
populate with all that information for the node.

Users
^^^^^

At the top of the node info tab you will see the following info:

* **USERNAME@DOMAIN.COM**: the UPN formatted name of the user, where
  USERNAME is the SAM Account Name, and DOMAIN.COM is the fully
  qualified domain name of the domain the user is in.
* **Sessions**: The count of computers this user has been observed
  logging onto. Click this number to visually see the connections
  between those computers and this user
* **Sibling Objects in the Same OU**: the number of other AD users, groups,
  and computers that belong to the same OU as this user. This can be
  very helpful when trying to figure out the lay of the land for an
  environment
* **Reachable High Value Targets**: The count of how many high value
  targets this user has an attack path to. A high value target is by
  default any computer or user that belongs to the domain admins,
  domain controllers, and several other high privilege Active Directory
  groups. Click this number to see the shortest attack paths from this user
  to those high value targets.
* **Effective Inbound GPOs**: the count of GPOs that apply to this user.
  Click the number to see the GPOs and how they apply to this user.
* **See user within Domain/OU Tree**: click this to see where the user
  is placed in the OU tree. This can give you insights about the
  geographic location of the user as well as organizational placement
  of the actual person.

Node Properties
---------------

* **Display name**: The Active Directory display name for the user
* **Object ID**: The user's SID. In neo4j this is stored as the user's
  objectid to uniquely identify the node
* **Password Last Changed**: The human-readable date for when the user's
  password last changed. This is stored internally in Unix epoch format
* **Last Logon**: The last time the domain controller you got this data from
  handled a logon request for the user
* **Last Logon (Replicated)**: The last time any domain controller handled
  a logon for this user
* **Enabled**: Whether the user object is enabled in Active Directory. Fun
  fact: if you control a disabled user object, you can re-enable that
  user object.
* **AdminCount**: Whether the user object in Active Directory currently,
  or possibly ever has belonged to a certain set of highly privileged
  groups. This property is related to the AdminSDHolder object and the
  SDProp process. Read about that here: https://adsecurity.org/?p=1906
* **Compromised**: Whether the user is marked as Owned. You can mark any
  user in the BloodHound GUI as Owned by right-clicking it and clicking
  "Mark User as Owned".
* **Password Never Expires**: Whether the UAC flag is set for the user in
  Active Directory to not require the user to update their password
* **Cannot Be Delegated**: Whether the UAC flag is set on the user in 
  Active Directory to disallow kerberos delegation for this user. If
  this is "True", then the user cannot be abused as part of a kerberos
  delegation attack
* **ASREP Roastable**: Whether the user can be ASREP roasted. For more info
  about that attack, see https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus#asreproast


Extra Properties
----------------

This section displays some other information about the node, plus all other
non-default, string-type property values from Active Directory if you used
the --CollectAllProperties flag. The default properties you'll see here
include:

* **distinguishedname**: The distinguished name (DN) of the user
* **domain**: The FQDN of the domain the user is in
* **name**: The UPN-formatted name of the user
* **passwordnotreqd**: Whether the UAC flag is set on the user object to
  not require the user to have a password. Note that this does not
  necessarily mean the user does *not* have a password, just that the user
  is allowed to not have one
* **userpassword**: Under certain conditions, you may have a clear-text
  password show up in this property. Most commonly, we have seen that some
  sort of Unix/Linux-based application will write a password to this property
  for an AD account the application is running as. This is possibly the
  current AD password for the user, but is not guaranteed to be the current
  password.
* **unconstraineddelegation**: Whether the user is allowed to perform
  unconstrained kerberos delegation. See more info about that here:
  https://www.harmj0y.net/blog/redteaming/another-word-on-delegation/

Group Membership
----------------

This section displays stats about Active Directory security grops the user
belongs to:

* **First Degree Group Memberships**: AD security groups the user is
  directly added to. If you typed `net user david.mcguire /domain`, for
  example, these are the groups you'd see this user belonging to.
* **Unrolled Group Membership**: Groups can be added to groups, and those
  group nestings can grant admin rights, control of AD objects, and other
  privileges to many more users than intended. These are the groups that
  this user effectively belongs to, because the groups the user explicitly
  belongs to have been added to those groups.
* **Foreign Group Membership**: Groups in other Active Directory domains
  this user belongs to

Local Admin Rights
------------------

* **First Degree Local Admin**: The number of computers that this user
  itself has been added to the local administrators group on. If you were
  to type `net localgroup administrators` on those systems, you would see
  this user in the list
* **Group Delegation Local Admin Rights**: AD security groups can be added
  to local administrator groups. This number shows the number of computers
  this user has local admin rights on through security group delegation,
  regardless of how deep those group nestings may go
* **Derivative Local Admin Rights**: This query does not run by default
  because it's a very expensive query for neo4j to run. If you press the play
  button here, neo4j will run the query and return the number of computers
  this user has "derivative" local admin rights on. For more info about
  this concept, see http://www.sixdub.net/?p=591

  has been added to the local Distributed COM Users group
* **Group Delegated DCOM Privileges**: The number of computers where this
  user has group delegated DCOM rights

  likely granted SA privileges on an MSSQL instance. This number is inferred
  by the number of computers listed on the user's serviceprincipalnames
  attribute where an MSSQL instance is referenced
* **Constrained Delegation Privileges**: The number of computers that trust
  this user to perform constrained delegation. This number is inferred by
  insepecting the msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo property on the user object in
  Active Directory and getting a count for how many computers are listed
  in that attribute

Outbound Object Control
-----------------------

* **First Degree Object Control**: The number of objects in AD where this

  the number of objects in Active Directory that this user can take control
  of, without relying on security group delegation
* **Group Delegated Object Control**: The number of objects in AD where this
  user has control via security group delegation, regardless of how deep those
  group nestings may go
* **Transitive Object Control**: The number of objects this user can gain control
  of by performing ACL-only based attacks in Active Directory. In other words,
  the maximum number of objects the user can gain control of without needing
  to pivot to any other system in the network, just by manipulating objects
  in the directory

Inbound Object Control
----------------------

* **Explicit Object Controllers**: The number of principals that are listed

  control of this object through security group delegation. This number can
  sometimes be wildly higher than the previous number

  group (and therefore the users belonging to this group) has an attack path to.
  A high value target is by default any computer or user that belongs to the domain
  admins, domain controllers, and several other high privilege Active Directory
  groups. Click this number to see the shortest attack paths from this user to
