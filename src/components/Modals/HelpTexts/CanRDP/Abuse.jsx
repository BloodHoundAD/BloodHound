            <h4>PlainText Credentials with Interactive Access</h4>
            With plaintext credentials, the easiest way to exploit this privilege is using the built in Windows Remote Desktop Client (mstsc.exe). Open mstsc.exe and input the computer ${targetName}. When prompted for credentials, input the credentials for ${
        sourceType === 'Group' ? `a member of ${sourceName}` : `${sourceName}`
    } to initiate the remote desktop connection.

            <h4>Password Hash with Interactive Access</h4>
            With a password hash, exploitation of this privilege will require local administrator privileges on a system, and the remote server must allow Restricted Admin Mode. 

            First, inject the NTLM credential for the user you're abusing into memory using mimikatz:
            
            <code>lsadump::pth /user:dfm /domain:testlab.local /ntlm:&lt;ntlm hash&gt; /run:"mstsc.exe /restrictedadmin"</code>

            This will open a new RDP window. Input the computer ${targetName} to initiate the remote desktop connection. If the target server does not support Restricted Admin Mode, the session will fail.

            <h4>Plaintext Credentials without Interactive Access</h4>
            This method will require some method of proxying traffic into the network, such as the socks command in cobaltstrike, or direct internet connection to the target network, as well as the xfreerdp (suggested because of support of Network Level Authentication (NLA)) tool, which can be installed from the freerdp-x11 package. If using socks, ensure that proxychains is configured properly. Initiate the remote desktop connection with the following command:

            <code>(proxychains) xfreerdp /u:dfm /d:testlab.local /v:&lt;computer ip&gt;</code>

            xfreerdp will prompt you for a password, and then initiate the remote desktop connection.

            This will initiate the remote desktop connection, and will fail if Restricted Admin Mode is not enabled.`;
