    There is at least one MSSQL instance running on ${targetName} where the user ${sourceName} is the account configured to run the SQL Server instance. The typical configuration for MSSQL is to have the local Windows account or Active Directory domain account that is configured to run the SQL Server service (the primary database engine for SQL Server) have sysadmin privileges in the SQL Server application. As a result, the SQL Server service account can be used to log into the SQL Server instance remotely, read all of the databases (including those protected with transparent encryption), and run operating systems command through SQL Server (as the service account) using a variety of techniques.

    For Windows systems that have been joined to an Active Directory domain, the SQL Server instances and the associated service account can be identified by executing a LDAP query for a list of "MSSQLSvc" Service Principal Names (SPN) as a domain user. In short, when the Database Engine service starts, it attempts to register the SPN, and the SPN is then used to help facilitate Kerberos authentication.
