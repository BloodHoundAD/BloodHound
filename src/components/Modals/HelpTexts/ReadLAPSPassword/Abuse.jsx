    <code>$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force
    $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('TESTLAB\\dfm.a', $SecPassword)</code>

    Then, use Get-DomainObject, optionally specifying $Cred if you are not already running a process as ${sourceName}:

    <code>Get-DomainObject windows1 -Credential $Cred -Properties "ms-mcs-AdmPwd",name</code>
    `;
    return { __html: text };
};
