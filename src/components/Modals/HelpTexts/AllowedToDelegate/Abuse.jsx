            In the following example, *victim* is the attacker-controlled account (i.e. the hash is known) that is configured for constrained delegation. That is, *victim* has the "HTTP/PRIMARY.testlab.local" service principal name (SPN) set in its msds-AllowedToDelegateTo property. The command first requests a TGT for the *victim* user and executes the S4U2self/S4U2proxy process to impersonate the "admin" user to the "HTTP/PRIMARY.testlab.local" SPN. The alternative sname "cifs" is substituted in to the final service ticket and the ticket is submitted to the current logon session. This grants the attacker the ability to access the file system of PRIMARY.testlab.local as the "admin" user.

            <code>Rubeus.exe s4u /user:victim /rc4:2b576acbe6bcfda7294d6bd18041b8fe /impersonateuser:admin /msdsspn:"HTTP/PRIMARY.testlab.local" /altservice:cifs /ptt</code>`;
