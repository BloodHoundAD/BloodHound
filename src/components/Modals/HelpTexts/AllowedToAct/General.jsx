    An attacker can use this account to execute a modified S4U2self/S4U2proxy abuse chain to impersonate any domain user to the target computer system and receive a valid service ticket "as" this user.
    
    One caveat is that impersonated users can not be in the "Protected Users" security group or otherwise have delegation privileges revoked. Another caveat is that the principal added to the msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity DACL *must* have a service pricipal name (SPN) set in order to successfully abuse the S4U2self/S4U2proxy process. If an attacker does not currently control an account with a SPN set, an attacker can abuse the default domain MachineAccountQuota settings to add a computer account that the attacker controls via the Powermad project.`;
